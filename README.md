### About Me

I am a data scientist just finishing a 6 month boot camp with Lambda School. Before
Lambda School, I was studying Politcal Science to work my way into the Foreign Service.
Outside of my fields of study, my main interests are gaming, reading, anime, and sports!

### Tech Stack
My primary coding language is Python, and I'm familiar with a number of its libraries
including: Pandas, NumPy, sklearn, TensorFlow, and SpaCy. I am also familiar with SQLite3 and
PostgreSQL.
